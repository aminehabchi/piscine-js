# piscine-js

## Overview

This repository contains my work for the **Piscine JS** project. The Piscine is an intensive learning program focused on JavaScript programming, designed to strengthen problem-solving skills, coding fundamentals, and collaborative development.

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned and practiced:
- Core JavaScript concepts: variables, functions, objects, arrays, and ES6+ features
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Debugging and testing JavaScript code
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Collaborative coding and code reviews
- Building and organizing projects using best practices

## Experience

I completed this exercise during a 1-month intensive Piscine in **Zone01 Oujda** in September 2024. The experience was challenging and rewarding, greatly improving my programming skills and ability to learn independently.


## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the instructors, peers, and the Zone01 Oujda community for their support and guidance.
